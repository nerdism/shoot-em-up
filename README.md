# shoot-em-up
ShootEmUp game from sfml game development book by Jan Haller, Henrik Vogelius Hansson, Artur Moreira 
<br>
my aim is to create games and get better in c++ so I'm reading sfml game development book and 
implementing the game mentioned on that book after I implemented the basic game I will refactor the code and add other libraries like thor, tgui, box2d, in order to have a engine or a framework so that I can create other games with it.

## Road Map
- [ ] copy ShootEmUp game from sfml book.
- [ ] Refactor using the thor library.
- [ ] Refactor using the tgui library.
- [ ] Replace box2d for colission handling.
- [ ] ReImplement using entt library.
- [ ] Add modding support with lua or python if possible.
- [ ] seperate the engine and game code.
- [ ] make another repo for engine.
