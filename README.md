# shoot-em-up
ShootEmUp game from sfml game development book by Jan Haller, Henrik Vogelius Hansson, Artur Moreira 
<br>
my aim is to create a simple engine with help of libraries to create games and i begin with this game.
## Road Map
- [ ] Reimplement or copy ShootEmUp game from sfml book in order to understand game programming.
- [ ] refactor the game with using the thor library instead of some manually written code.
- [ ] refactor the game with using the tgui library instead of pure sfml.
- [ ] replace box2d for colission handling.
- [ ] Reimplment the game the help of entt library.
- [ ] Add modding support with lua or python if possible.
- [ ] seperate the engine and game code.
- [ ] make another repo for engine.


first we are gonna copy the game mentioned in the book and after completing it we refactor it and 
add Thor library instead of some code that we written, then gonna replace box2d for colission handling and at the end 
gonna use the entt library.
